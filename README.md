## Overview
In this assignment, I made a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone’s SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Expected Outcomes
The LIRI Bot was designed to produce search results based on the following commands:

- node liri.js concert-this
- node liri.js spotify-this-song
- node liri.js movie-this
- node liri.js do-what-it-says

Each command produced different search results as listed below:

- node liri.js concert-this “artist/band name”
    - Name of venue
    - Venue location
    - Date of the event in MM/DD/YYYY format

- node liri.js spotify-this-song “song/track name”
    - Artist
    - Song
    - Spotify song preview url
    - Album

- node liri.js movie-this “movie title”
    - Title of the movie
    - Year the movie came out
    - IMDB Rating of the movie
    - Country where the movie was produced
    - Language of the movie
    - Plot of the movie
    - Actors in the movie
    - Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie

- node liri.js do-what-it-says

    - Print the spotify results for “I want it that way” stored in the random.txt file
